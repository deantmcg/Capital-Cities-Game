# Capital Cities Game

Welcome to the **Capital Cities Game**, a simple trivia game that tests your knowledge of countries from around the world and their capital cities!

## Overview

This project was originally developed in 2018 as part of a **Visual Programming module** during my foundation degree. The assignment required building an interactive game, which led to the creation of this fun capital cities quiz.

In 2024, I revisited the code and **refactored** it, applying many of the lessons I've learned since the original submission. These improvements focus on code structure, readability, and maintainability while preserving the original game's core functionality.

## Game Features

- **Trivia Questions**: Guess the capital city of a given country.
- **Difficulty Levels**: The game adjusts difficulty dynamically as the player progresses.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks your correct and incorrect answers and adjusts scores based on performance.

## Refactor Highlights

- **Improved Code Structure**: Better class separation and more efficient logic.
- **New Classes**: Added `GameDetails`, `Question`, `Country`, and `CapitalCity` classes for cleaner object-oriented design.
- **Optimised High Score Management**: Scores are now more effectively stored and retrieved.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **WinForms**
- **Visual Studio**

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deantmcg/Capital-Cities-Game.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the solution.

## Future Enhancements

Some future improvements I have in mind include:
- Better difficulty adjustment algorithms.
- Improved storage solutions for game data.
- Addition of more countries and capitals to the quiz.

## Acknowledgements

This project holds special significance as one of my first coding assignments. The refactor is an ongoing effort to reflect my growth as a developer and make the code more professional.
